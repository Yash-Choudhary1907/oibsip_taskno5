In data analytics, predicting house prices with linear regression involves analyzing historical housing data to build a model that can estimate the price of a house based on various features.
Key Steps:
Data Collection: Gather historical data on houses, including features like size, location, number of bedrooms, and the actual sale prices.
Data Preparation: Clean and preprocess the data. This may involve handling missing values, normalizing features, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.
Feature Selection: Identify the key factors (features) that influence house prices. Common features include square footage, number of bedrooms, location, and age of the house.
Model Building: Use linear regression to create a predictive model. The model tries to find the best-fitting line (or hyperplane in higher dimensions) that relates the features to the house price. The relationship is modeled as:
Training the Model: The model is trained using the training data by adjusting the coefficients to minimize the error between predicted prices and actual prices. This is usually done using techniques like ordinary least squares (OLS).
Model Evaluation: After training, evaluate the model's performance using the testing data. Metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) or R-squared are used to assess accuracy.
Prediction: Once the model is validated, it can predict house prices for new data based on the learned relationship between features and prices.
